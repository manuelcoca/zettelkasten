-   Smith: Money is not the end goal, but a means to productivity and division of labor
-   Mises use-value & regression theorem:
    -   Fiat money lacks intrinsic value
    -   If a commodity is no longer used as money (i.e., for exchange), it retains intrinsic usage (e.g., gold for jewelry).
    -   Fiat money = use-value if it ceases to be a medium of exchange
