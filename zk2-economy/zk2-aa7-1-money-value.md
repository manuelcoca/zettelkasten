According to Smith:

-   Value = Labor theory of value and its scarcity - E.g gold's value stems from its labor cost to mine
    According to Mises:
-   Money value = Subjective, emerges from people
-   People assign value to money based on future purchasing power -> creates network effect -> increasing liquidity
-   Price levels = supply (e.g., money stock) and demand (e.g., transactions or hoarding)
