###### Content

-   Promise: control inflation, ensure price stability, and maintain market function
-   Evidence: no success, 147 banking crisis (1970-2011), continious inflation. Focus on supporting government debt over controlling inflation.
-   Influence: all asset classes (bonds, private equity etc.) through easing/tightening decisions
-   Crisis frequency stable, but forms (e.g., twin crises) and severity (output loss, fiscal costs) often increase
-   Central bank actions delay problems but make government debt issues worse over time.
