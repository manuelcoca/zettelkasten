###### Content

According to Smith:

-   Usage of gold and silver, because of their durability, divisibility, and portability -> solve barter issues
-   Metals had intrinsic value due to their scarcity and industrial use
-   Primary economic role of gold was to represent value rather than be value itself
    According to Mises:
-   Same view
-   Something first becomes money with direct use-value (like gold for industrial purposes)
-   The more people recognize it = the higher liquidity
-   At some point, the commodity role sheds and becomes "money", used not for consumption but solely for exchange
