## welcome

This is my personal digital zettelkasten where I collect, create, link and share my knowledge, thoughts and ideas.

I'm not here to inspire; my aim is to enhance my own understanding and have my knowledge validated.

## themes

I'm passionate about interdisciplinary themes, with the goal of bridging:

-   software engineering,
-   economics and
-   philosophy.

I believe that, all 3 themes will be crucial to pioneer the future.

## contact

I'm open-minded and happy to engage in intellectual dialogue with anyone who's interested. I welcome ideas, critic, or just exchange.
