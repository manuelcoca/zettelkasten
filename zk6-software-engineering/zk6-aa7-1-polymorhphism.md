-   Polymorphism = uniform treatment of types via interfaces.
-   All programs have a function call tree. Flow of control = top to bottom.
    -   Problem: Parent modules depend on child modules (via imports), creating tight coupling.
-   Tight coupling = fragile code which is hard to change.
-   Polymorphism = inverting the dependency / flow of control by defining an interface between two modules = loose coupling
-   Polymorphism = gives you control of the dependency structure
-   Good dependency management = more reusable, less fragile code.
-   Polymorphism is not excusively OOP and can also be achieved in any language with interfaces or types
