-   Procedure = **action-centered design** =
    -   No relationship between data types and functions/behaviour
-   Object-oriented = **data-centered design**
    -   State is seperated in units
    -   Think about data and functions/behaviour that belong together
-   Imperative = **do modify state**
    -   Mutate state whenever needed, no shared state handling
-   Functional = **don't modify state**
    -   Pure functions with no state, minimising state as much as possible
    -   Think about data as immutable
-   **Procedural & Imperative** = no relationship between data and functions, state is mutated whenever needed. Problem is solved whenever it arises. Shared state issues led to next paradigm.
-   **Procedural & functional** = fix shared state issues by minimizing state
-   **Object-oriented & imperative** = seperating states into objects
-   **Object-oriented & functional** = minimizing the shared state to deal with, leftover state is segregated into units of encapsulation
