-   Rise of abstractions, today we just build and want to make it work
-   Architectural decisions are often embodied in today’s modern frameworks = today it’s more about decisions what cloud platform I use, how do I combine the frameworks and tools etc.
-   Complex or risky systems still need strict design methods (e.g UML), but many modern business and startup projects do well with simple approaches, using ready-made parts and cloud services. This shows why formal design methods are more or less popular in different cases.

==Software engineering has historically progressed through increasing levels of abstraction. This shift means architects now face systemic problems involving economic and infrastructure considerations beyond pure software design. - Grady Booch==
