Maintainability

-   is to make the code easy to read for someone who is unfamiliar with it.
-   is about how do you find the place to make the required change now and how do ensure that your changes are isolated?
-   is not about avoiding bugs

==The value of maintainable code is writing code so that when the bugs happen, and they will happen, you can find them, and you can fix them, and you can write tests to make sure they do not pop up again. - Internet of Bugs==
