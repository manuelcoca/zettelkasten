###### Content

The main difference between different programming paradigms are how the shared state issue is tackled.

Other differences:

-   **Abstraction:** OOP uses objects and classes, functional programming uses functions and higher-order functions, and procedural programming uses procedures.
-   **Control Flow:** Functional programming favors recursion and declarative patterns, while OOP and procedural programming often use imperative loops and conditionals.
-   **Composition vs. Inheritance:** OOP emphasizes composition or inheritance, while functional programming avoids inheritance entirely.
-   **Philosophy:** OOP models real-world entities (objects), functional programming models computations as mathematical functions, and procedural programming focuses on sequential steps.
