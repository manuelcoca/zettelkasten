###### Content

-   Abstraction = breaking down complexity = essence of software design
-   Abstraction = best way to reduce complexity
-   Abstraction = simplifies complexity by exposing only the essential features or interfaces, making it easier to understand, use, and maintain code.
-   Paradox = bad abstraction = increase in complexity
-   Don't implement abstractions unless the need is there. The need is there when a change affects other parts of the code.
-   The most difficult part of abstraction is to find a good design leading to least possible changes later. In reality the system and business requirements evolve and change over time.

==Unpredictable changes, even during development, will always come up.==
