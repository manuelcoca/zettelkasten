OOP is a set of collaborating objects. The collaborate by sending messages to each other (function calls). The sender doesn't know and care how the receiver will respond. One interface can have many implementations of objects. The sender doesn't care which implementation is receiving his message = decoupling.

**Four pillars:** polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction & inheritance.
