Monorepo:
+Starts efficient
+Initially good maintainability
-Both efficiency and maintainability decrease over time
-Becomes less flexible for implementing breaking changes

Microrepo:

-Lower initial efficiency
-Adds complexity from the beginning
-Maintainability becomes more challenging over time

==Only good reason for a new repo is a have clear project boundary==
