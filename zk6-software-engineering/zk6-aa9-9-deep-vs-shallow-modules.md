"A “deep” module provides a simple interface but encapsulates significant complexity and functionality internally. This reduces cognitive load for users and helps manage complexity. “Shallow” modules have wide or complex interfaces but little internal functionality, exposing complexity rather than hiding it, which is detrimental to maintainability." - John Ousterhout

=="A balance favoring deeper, well-encapsulated modules is preferable." - John Ousterhout==
