-   Track trust in relationships like a bank account.
-   Deposits: Build trust with politeness, kindness, honesty, and reliability—neglect this, and marriages fail.

Six Key Deposits:

-   1. Understand Others: Value what matters to them—like going to your son’s soccer game for him, not the sport.
-   Golden Rule: Treat others as you’d want to be treated.
-   2. Small Things Matter: Small favors build trust; small rudenesses drain it—like a kid sad over a blanket.
-   3. Keep Promises: Honoring commitments boosts trust; breaking them wipes it out.
-   4. Clarify Expectations: Define roles and tasks clearly to avoid arguments—it takes guts.
-   5. Integrity: Be honest, keep promises, and stay loyal to the absent—how you treat one shows how you view all.
-   6. Apologize Sincerely: Heartfelt apologies fix withdrawals; insecure people avoid this, fearing weakness.
-   Business Tip: Customer problems are chances to build trust as an entrepreneur.
