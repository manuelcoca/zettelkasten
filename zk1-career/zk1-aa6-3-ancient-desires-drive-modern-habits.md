-   All habits are dopamine driven by brains that are 50,000 years old.
-   Our ancient reward system can harm us in today's environment.
-   Craving is a manifestation of underlying ancient desires:
    -   Find love and reproduce → Tinder
    -   Social approval → Instagram
    -   Status and prestige → Games
-   The underlying motivations remain the same; only the habits change over time.
-   Understanding these evolutionary drivers helps design better modern habits.
