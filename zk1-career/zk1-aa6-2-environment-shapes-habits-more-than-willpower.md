-   Context matters - our habits are deeply linked to environments (e.g., smoking on balcony).
-   Self-control is short term and takes too much energy to maintain long-term.
-   No one can hold good habits in negative environments - change environment instead.
-   Habit stacks work by linking new habits to existing environmental cues.
-   Environmental design is more powerful than individual willpower for lasting change.
