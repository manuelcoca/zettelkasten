Relationships everyone should have:

1. family
2. close friends,
3. mentors,
4. business network,
5. love.

**Mentors:** Not for motivating your, but for answering specific questions from experience.

**Business Network:** It’s about who knows you, not who you know—build it by meeting people, connecting over common ground, and staying in touch.

**Love:** Less is more—focus on quality time, treat them how you want to be treated, and don’t talk bad about to friends.
