Two Types of People:

-   **Type A**: Most people shout complaints, like spectators shout at a soccer game. They criticize everything - taxes, education, etc. - but don't step onto the field to make an impact.
-   **Type B**: Only few, which work and train hard to "play the ball" themselves. They don't waste energy and focus on results.

Be **Type B** to change something in the world.
