###### Content

-   Lamarckism: biological adaptations acquired during lifetime are inherited by descendants.
-   AI achieving knowledge accumulation is like Lamarckism - only manifestation of existing knowledge.
-   After intended aim is reached, no further improvements are made automatically.
-   David Deutsch argues: AI has all knowledge built in from programmer, unlike true evolution.
-   The analogue of evolutionary change is creative thought in a person.
-   Knowledge is not created through running the program but through creativity of the programmer.

> "There are serious unknowns in nature like creativity and consciousness so how can we expect to simulate it in a computer program."
